# React Practical 19

####  

Refactor Practical 05 to fetch initial todos and store them in redux store.

Similarly, complete the CRUD by using the following APIs:
https://freeapi.hashnode.space/api-guide/apireference/deleteTodo
https://freeapi.hashnode.space/api-guide/apireference/getTodoById
https://freeapi.hashnode.space/api-guide/apireference/createTodo
https://freeapi.hashnode.space/api-guide/apireference/updateTodo
https://freeapi.hashnode.space/api-guide/apireference/getAllTodos
Furthermore, for this practical, remove the logic of persisting the todos as we are fetching them directly from API. Update the UI to show loaders/indicators as and when needed.

Guidelines:

Create a separate repo
Create branch as and when needed
Commit your code daily, use atomic and meaningful commits
Raise PRs on daily basis
Do not merge before review
Deploy this practical
Share repo URL, link of raised PRs and deployed URL here.
